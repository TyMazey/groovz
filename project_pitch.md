## Project Title: Groovz

### Pitch

Takes multiple Spotify users' listening data and makes a playlist comprised of common
artists, genres, and styles for the members of that "Party".

### Problem

When a group forms, it is difficult and potentially uncomfortable to decide on the music
that should be played. This extends to many social gatherings, including parties,
road trips, family gatherings, and even just a night in with a partner.

### Solution

We will solve this problem by providing a platform where a user can create a session,
referred to as a "Party". Other users can join the Party using a Party ID and a
party Password. When a user joins the party, the system will re-assess the common
interests and adjust the generated playlist.

### Target Audience

Users who frequently find themselves in social situations and use Spotify.
